# This OWNERS file is here since changes in the build/slave/ directory that
# introduce bugs can cause all slaves everywhere to fail to reboot properly.
# Ideally, only changes to this directory can ever cause all slaves to go
# offline.  Only this OWNERS file will be needed to keep ensure bad changes
# don't get landed, knocking out the bots.
