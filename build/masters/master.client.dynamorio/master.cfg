# before you have a functioning 'sources' set up). The debug tool uses the
# same port number as the slaves do: 'slavePortnum'.

#c['debugPassword'] = 'debugpassword'

# if you set 'manhole', you can ssh into the buildmaster and get an
# interactive python shell, which may be useful for debugging buildbot
# internals. It is probably only useful for buildbot developers. You can also
# use an authorized_keys file, or plain telnet.
