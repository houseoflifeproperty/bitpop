####### BUILDERS

# buildbot/process/factory.py provides several BuildFactory classes you can
# start with, which implement build processes for common targets (GNU
# autoconf projects, CPAN perl modules, etc). The factory.BuildFactory is the
# base class, and is configured with a series of BuildSteps. When the build
# is run, the appropriate buildslave is told to execute each Step in turn.

# the first BuildStep is typically responsible for obtaining a copy of the
# sources. There are source-obtaining Steps in buildbot/process/step.py for
# CVS, SVN, and others.

# BUILDER DEFINITIONS

# The 'builders' list defines the Builders. Each one is configured with a
# dictionary, using the following keys:
#  name (required): the name used to describe this bilder
#  builddir (required): which subdirectory to run the builder in
#  factory (required): a BuildFactory to define how the build is run
#  periodicBuildTime (optional): if set, force a build every N seconds
#  category (optional): it is not used in the normal 'buildbot' meaning. It is
#                       used by gatekeeper to determine which steps it should
#                       look for to close the tree.
